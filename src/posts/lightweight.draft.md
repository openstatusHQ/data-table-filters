A few months ago, we released the vercel-edge-ping repository to monitor your http endpoints via vercel's edge regions. Within 5 minutes, you can define your endpoints and deploy it to vercel. We have an extensive README guide or you can checkout the YouTube video how to deploy it.

Now, we are happy to announce that we have added a UI support if you are using the Tinybird option to store the ping responses.

It's another showcase of the data-table-filters project on how to configure the different options/fields to display a fully functional logs table.
